# Mandelbrot Set Visualization #

This is a python program that uses pillow and numba for creating an image of the mandelbrot set.
I still want to add some more features like Julia sets, animation and color based on number of iteration steps.
This project is inspired by [this numberphile video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFftmWSzgmk&t=185s), as well as [this 3blue1brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqbZpur38nw).

This was mostly a learning experience, however I still want to come back to this and develop this tool further, adding features and optmizing it using the GPU to render the images.
